# Akeeba Release System

A download manager component for Joomla!, designed for the distribution of Akeeba software.

## INTERNAL PROJECT

This software is only meant to be used only on our site and caters only to our business goals. 

We do not provide support for it. We do not take feature requests for it. We do not even provide downloads for it.

There is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that any feature implemented today will be available in the future or that
the component will continue to work the same or even exist. The project does not even follow semver.
